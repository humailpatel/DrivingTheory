      "General guidance": "Pedestrians should always use footpaths or pavements where provided, and should never walk on the road where there is a safe alternative.",
      "Crossings": {
        "Zebra crossings": "At a zebra crossing, pedestrians have priority over vehicles. Pedestrians should look both ways before crossing and should not step out into the road until it is safe to do so.",
        "Pelican crossings": "Pelican crossings have traffic lights that pedestrians can use to cross the road. Pedestrians should only cross when the green man is showing.",
        "Toucan crossings": "Toucan crossings are like pelican crossings, but they also allow cyclists to cross.",
        "Puffin crossings": "Puffin crossings have sensors that detect when pedestrians are crossing and adjust the crossing time accordingly.",
        "School crossing patrols": "School crossing patrols are employed to help children cross the road safely. Drivers should always obey their signals and stop when requested to do so."
